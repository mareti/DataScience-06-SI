## Introduction
This is the markdown document that explains the code and results from Quiz 1

```{r q1}
p_aub = 0.17
p_a = 0.12
p_anb = 0.06

p_b = p_aub + p_anb - p_a
p_b
```

MAYBE next time I do a quiz I should do it in R Markdown instead of a standard R file! Then I can properly talk about what I'm doing :)

I don't have to write a million functions either, and look! it auto wraps at 80 characters!!
